# MinesFinder 💣🔍

MinesFinder is a grid-based puzzle game inspired by the classic **Minesweeper**.  
The objective is to reveal all safe cells while avoiding hidden mines by using logical deduction and numerical hints.

Instead of traditional flags, players can mark cells using different indicators to help track possible mine locations.

## Features ✨

### 🧩 Core Gameplay
- Grid-based board
- Random mine generation
- Numerical hints indicating nearby mines
- Safe cell revealing
- Automatic expansion of empty areas

### ⚠️ Cell Marking System
Players can mark suspicious cells using two types of indicators:

- **Red `!`** – High probability that the cell contains a mine  
- **Yellow `?`** – Uncertain cell that may contain a mine  

These markings help players track potential dangers and avoid accidental reveals.

### 💣 Mine Detection
Each revealed cell displays a number representing the number of mines in the **8 surrounding cells**:
- Horizontal
- Vertical
- Diagonal

This information allows the player to deduce where mines are located.

### 🎮 Game States
The game progresses through different states:

- **Start** – A new board is generated  
- **Playing** – The player reveals and marks cells  
- **Win** – All safe cells have been revealed  
- **Lose** – A mine is revealed

## How the Game Works ⚙️

1. A board is generated with a predefined number of mines.
2. The player selects a cell to reveal.
3. If the cell contains a mine → the game ends.
4. If the cell is safe → a number appears showing nearby mines.
5. If the cell has **0 adjacent mines**, neighboring cells are automatically revealed.
6. The player wins when all non-mine cells are revealed.

## Controls 🕹️

Typical player actions:

- **Reveal Cell** – Opens the selected cell (**Mouse 1**)  
- **Mark Cell** – Cycles through markers (**Mouse 2**):
  - `!` → suspected mine  
  - `?` → uncertain
